An eCommerce microservice architecture with an API Gateway 
includes independent services for handling specific business functions like products, orders,  
and user accounts.  

• The API Gateway serves as a single-entry point for managing client requests, routing them to 
appropriate microservices, and enforcing security policies.  

• Rate limiting controls the number of requests a client can make to prevent abuse and ensure fair 
usage. 

•  Caching stores frequently accessed data to improve performance and reduce load on services.  

• Retry strategies ensure reliability by automatically retrying failed requests due to transient errors. 
This setup enhances scalability, performance, and resilience for online shopping platforms.
